				<span class="time-wrapper"><span class="time">2019</span></span>
			</div>
			<div class="desc">around this time is when I really started to watch how people developed things, and i loved watching people code, and I loved the concept of it but I could never find how to do it, and I didnt have te resources available to do anything, so i would just sit and watch people make websites.</div>

			</div>
			<div class="desc">In 2020 is when the corona virus hit, in march is when my school went into fully online. During this time I didnt have much to do so I was finally able to learn how to code and what to do. I was a big fan of the game Minecraft, so I decided to work on making things for it, all of those things were in PHP, and I worked on that for about 1 - 2 months and learned alot about PHP and also alot about programming in general.</div>

				<span class="time-wrapper"><span class="time">May - 2020</span></span>
			</div>
			<div class="desc">In May of 202 is when I started doing offical work for the minecraft server Versai, this has taught me alot about developing things and making improvs to get things to work. During this time I was told ot make some addons, and a server. This is all in TypeScript, and ive been using it ever since. During this time I made some simple things and some more complex things, such as commands that will teleport you somewhere up to Gangs. During this time I was working with people so they would help me out if I was struggling, and it would be a nice thing to me because I would have someone to show me how to do it so that nextime I wont need them.</div>

			</div>
			<div class="desc">During this time I really wanted to go back to why I started, Websites. Websites are super fun to do, and are one of the best things to code in my opinion. Ive been making websites since back in 2017, but I really dont think I did much then. So I stpped up and said that I can make a website for the team, and thats what im doing to this day.</div>
